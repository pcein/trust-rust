Generic functions are "monomorphed" by the compiler; ie,
two invocations of the same generic fn with parameters having
different types will result in the compiler actually implementing
two versions of the function specialized for each type. This
can be easily verified by looking at the generated asm code.

(https://rust.godbolt.org/ is a good way to check asm output with
cleaned-up symbols)
